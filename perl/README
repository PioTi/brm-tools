This folder is for Perl-based efforts. For sure, this is an effort to reach the basement first.

BRM::Testnap

This Perl module drives testnap through pipes. The module allows a Perl programmer to interact with BRM using Perl's Hashes.

With Perl and testnap, you should be able to make some useful one off programs that can use you favorite, system level Perl. You don't need a 32 bit build with a, b and c limits.

Java is, as always an option for BRM. If you are bad enough to use Perl, you are certainly with enough poor judgement to use Java. Show me a LOCK CAS.
